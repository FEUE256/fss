      <h2 id="WIF">What is FSS?</h2>
      <p>FSS (Fix System Services) is an advanced diagnostic and repair utility designed to identify,   monitor, and fix issues within core system services on Windows-based machines. Developed with flexibility and performance in mind, FSS continuously scans for failures in essential services such as networking, system updates, storage access, device communication, and background processes that are vital for system stability.

        FSS operates in real time and is built for both local use and remote diagnostics across a network. It provides automatic recovery functions, logs all detected events and system changes, and offers both manual and automated repair options. Each service issue is tracked in a structured log system with timestamps, severity levels, and potential impact.

        FSS is ideal for advanced users, IT professionals, and system administrators who require a clear, organized, and actionable interface to understand and resolve system-level problems efficiently. With a strong focus on security and system integrity, every action performed by FSS is transparent, logged, and reversible when possible.

        In combination with your own custom integrations (such as Node.js, JSON-based data collectors, and device monitors), FSS can act as the core brain of a smart self-healing computer system.
